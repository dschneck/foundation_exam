# Foundation Exam Prep
I'm trying to organize my efforts to study for the next FE: __January 16th, 2021__
## Schedule
Every week is split up based on the different sections provided in the UCF Foundation Exam Outline, located in the __ucf-material__ folder.
Along with the 2-3 modules of focus for the week, I will also be studying one of the sorting algorithms.
Finally, at the end of each week I will take/review one of the previous exams.

Week 1 starts on December 13th, 2020.
